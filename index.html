        <p class="hero-lead">
          The first digits of a card number are not random. Bank Identification Numbers (BINs) reveal which
          bank issued the card, which network it runs on, what country it belongs to and often what type of
          product it is. This page explains how BINs fit into modern payment technology.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Bank Identification Number (BIN)?</h2>
      <p>
        A Bank Identification Number is the leading part of a card number that tells the payment network
        which issuer and product they are dealing with. Historically this was the first 6 digits, but many
        systems now work with 8-digit BINs as payment volumes and product types have grown.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a transaction is initiated, the terminal and acquiring bank use the BIN to route the
        authorisation request to the correct card network and issuing bank. The BIN also signals things like:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li>Which <strong>network</strong> the card uses (Visa, Mastercard, etc.).</li>
        <li>Which <strong>issuer</strong> owns the relationship with the cardholder.</li>
        <li>The typical <strong>country or region</strong> of issuance.</li>
        <li>Sometimes the <strong>product type</strong> (debit, credit, prepaid, business, premium).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small mt-3">
        BINs are part of the behind-the-scenes plumbing that make card payments work. They do not reveal
        personal information by themselves, but they do tell the system how the card should be treated.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Structure -->
    <section id="structure" class="section">
      <h2>How BINs Are Structured on a Card</h2>
      <p>
        A full card number (PAN – Primary Account Number) contains several pieces of information encoded in
        sequence. The BIN is the leading block, followed by digits that identify the cardholder account and a
        final check digit.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the exact structure can vary by network and issuer, a simplified view looks like this:
      </p>

      <div class="table-wrap mt-4">
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Segment</th>
              <th>Typical length</th>
              <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>BIN / IIN</td>
              <td>6–8 digits</td>
              <td>Identifies network, issuer, region and often product type.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Account identifier</td>
              <td>Varies</td>
              <td>Links the card to a specific customer account at the issuer.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Check digit</td>
              <td>1 digit</td>
              <td>Used by the Luhn algorithm to detect simple input errors.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p class="small mt-3">
        For most consumers, the exact digits beyond the BIN are not important. For merchants, processors and
        risk systems, correctly interpreting the BIN is essential.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risk & routing -->
    <section id="risk" class="section">
      <h2>How BINs Are Used for Risk Checks &amp; Routing</h2>
      <p>
        BIN data feeds into fraud-prevention, pricing and routing decisions long before a transaction is
        either approved or declined. Typical uses include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Geographic checks:</strong> comparing card country to IP, device location or merchant region.</li>
        <li><strong>Product-type checks:</strong> handling debit, credit, prepaid and corporate cards differently.</li>
        <li><strong>Fee logic:</strong> applying the right interchange and scheme fees for each transaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Fallback rules:</strong> deciding how to route if one network path is temporarily unavailable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Modern fraud engines often maintain their own BIN tables, updated when new ranges or product lines are
        launched. Outdated BIN data can lead to false declines or mispriced transactions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- BINs, product types & profiles -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>BINs, Product Types and Customer Profiles</h2>
      <p>
        A single issuer can operate many BINs to separate products. One BIN might be used for standard consumer
        credit cards, another for premium travel cards, another for corporate or small-business products, and
        yet another for prepaid or virtual-only cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        For card programmes, this separation helps:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li>Segment <strong>risk and pricing</strong> by product type.</li>
        <li>Apply different <strong>features and benefits</strong> at the BIN level.</li>
        <li>Manage <strong>migration</strong> when products are upgraded or closed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small mt-3">
        From a user perspective, this is invisible – but it is part of why cards with different benefits or
        fees can behave differently in the background, even from the same bank.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- BINs & modern tech -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>BINs in Modern Payment Technology</h2>
      <p>
        As virtual cards, tokenization and wallet-based payments have grown, BINs still sit at the core of the
        system. Whether a card is stored in a phone wallet, used with wearables, or issued as a single-use
        virtual number, the underlying BIN usually points back to the same issuer and product family.
      </p>
      <p>
        New BIN ranges have also been introduced to support:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Digital-first issuers</strong> and fintech card programmes.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-branded cards</strong> with specific merchants or loyalty schemes.</li>
        <li><strong>Specialised business products</strong> for expenses and virtual cards.</li>
      </ul>
