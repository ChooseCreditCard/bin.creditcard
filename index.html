          Every payment card starts with a small cluster of digits that quietly describes the issuer, network, product type and region. Bin.Creditcard breaks down how Bank Identification Numbers (BINs) work and how they shape routing, risk checks and fees.

    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What is a Bank Identification Number (BIN)?</h2>
      <p>
        A Bank Identification Number, sometimes called an Issuer Identification Number (IIN), is the sequence of digits at the start of a card number that identifies the payment network and the issuing institution. Historically this was the first six digits; many schemes are now expanding to eight as card volumes grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        From those digits alone, payment systems can infer whether a card is debit or credit, consumer or commercial, basic or premium, and which country or region it belongs to. This information is used before the full PAN is even evaluated, making BIN data a critical shortcut in card processing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How BINs Drive Routing and Authorisation</h2>
      <p>
        When a card is tapped, dipped or entered online, the terminal packages the card details into an authorisation request. The BIN is read first and determines which network should receive the message, and then which issuer or processor should ultimately approve or decline the transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, acquirers and payment gateways use BIN data to apply correct interchange tables, select routing options, enforce region-based rules and decide whether extra checks such as 3-D Secure or step-up authentication should be triggered. All of this happens in milliseconds based on a handful of digits at the front of the card.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>BIN Ranges, Card Levels and Product Mapping</h2>
      <p>
        Issuers typically control whole ranges of BINs, allocating specific blocks to different portfolios: entry-level cards, premium travel products, corporate cards or co-branded programmes. Each range is registered with the networks so that downstream systems can recognise the product behind the number.
      </p>
      <p>
        For merchants and PSPs, accurate BIN tables help distinguish between domestic and cross-border cards, consumer and commercial usage, or standard and premium tiers. That, in turn, influences surcharging rules, acceptance policies and the economics of each transaction.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>BINs, Fraud Controls and Risk Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        BIN intelligence feeds directly into fraud engines. Certain ranges may be flagged as higher risk due to historical chargebacks, cross-border patterns or association with particular merchant categories. Other ranges might be treated as lower risk because they correspond to strong KYC processes or secure authentication flows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combining BIN data with geolocation, device fingerprints and transaction history allows risk systems to decide whether to approve seamlessly, challenge with additional checks or block outright. For online merchants, keeping BIN tables up to date is one of the simplest ways to improve both approval rates and fraud defences.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Data Quality, Compliance and Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        BIN databases are maintained by card schemes and republished through official registries and third-party tools. Because card products evolve, mergers happen and portfolios are re-issued, the underlying data is constantly changing. Out-of-date tables can lead to incorrect routing choices or misclassified fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, BIN usage must respect privacy and compliance rules. Processors focus on the structural information — issuer, country, product type — rather than cardholder identity. Good governance around BIN data helps payment providers stay aligned with scheme rules, local regulation and data-minimisation principles.
